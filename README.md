# Anamorphic Encryption Prototype

This is a basic simulation of the concept presented in the paper:
**Anamorphic Encryption: Private Communication against a Dictator** (EUROCRYPT 2022)

## Features

- Cover encryption using AES
- Embeds a hidden (anamorphic) message into ciphertext
- Hidden message is undetectable without special decoder

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
